Been thinking about PCA a lot lately and how it relates to design synthesis  and “connecting the dots”/making the abductive leap.

PCA is pattern identifier and dimension reducer. PCA identifies axes/dimensions—“principle components”—that highlight the highest variations/spacings in clusters of data. See the UK example: the Principle Component Analysis identified a principle component which clustered Wales, England and Scotland together but left N Ireland as an outlier—highly separated.

The thing I am stuck on is that when we’re looking at something the “3D Example”, we have really good separation along PC1, but we then have really good CLUSTERING along PC3. 

I am not even sure what to make of this… but it strikes me as important to the notion that clusters 1 2 and 3 are VERY separate along axis X, but also VERY strong alignment when viewed on axis Yprime.

…maybe that’s not that interesting, but MAN is it stuck in my head.

I’ve been wondering if “reframing” is comparable to changing the axes of reference to identify a principle component (dragging around the plot in the 3D example). 

Reframing isn’t just a “different way of looking at things”… it’s a perspective which places importance on a particular axis that creates alignment/connection among some data, which from the most logical/rational vantage, appears to be extraordinarily separate.

Maybe design framing is actually the opposite of PCA?

In PCA you’re searching for the greatest SEPARATION—this is PC1—but in design you are looking for the greatest interrelation—PC2, which in the example is be the 90˚ Y axis transform from PC1.
