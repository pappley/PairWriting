Design Models, Product Models

1. Kumar
Spatial, rather than linear
Explicitly(?) iterative
Places making and understanding in opposition
Places abstract and real in opposition


2. Double Diamond DCUK
Explicitly linear
Explicitly dilineates convergent/divergent thinking

Can be construde as a spatial map placing the second diamond beneath
diverging on the problem, converging on the problem
diverging on the solution, converging on the solution

Not sure if this maps well to Kumar...
Abstraction/synthesis is an important concept isn't well highlighted by DD


3. Manzini
spatial map
non-iterative
sensemaking and problem solving are in opposition
expert design and diffuse design are in opposition



"Problem solving" has always been a sticky statement for me. 
Is problem solving not a result of the process, rather than a moment point or specific endeavor? 
It's a collective result, rather than a conscious action. 
It's sortve like "making dinner"â€”that's a result of a bunch of sub-steps, you cannot "make dinner" as an act...?
