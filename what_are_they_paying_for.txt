Product Ownership and Work of the Highest Value

OH: “I’ve never been a product owner before so I am not exactly sure what I should be doing”

Provocation 1: 
the job of the PO is to determine acceptance criteria and pull new work when there is capacity.

This is the definition I am currently working in.

This becomes problematic when, from the product owner’s perspective, the WHOLE PROJECT is the highest value thing. 

This becomes problematic when the product owner understands value-based  prioritization but the locus of value for the PO—or above the PO—shifts frequently.

This becomes problematic when more fundamental Ownership work hasn’t been completed.



Fundamental ownership

The fundamental job of the PO is to construct information flows from the customer to the product team. 

These flows help define value, act as a regulator for pulling work, and contribute to the synthesis of new concepts.
