Product Ownership and Work of the Highest Value

“I’ve never been a product owner before so I am not exactly sure what I should be doing”

What should a Product Owner be focused on? What does it mean to “own” the product? Why does work feel disjointed and lack meaningful flow and sequence?



Provocation 1: 
The job of the PO is to determine acceptance criteria and pull the highest value work when there is capacity.

This becomes problematic when, from the product owner’s perspective, the WHOLE PROJECT is the highest value work. 

This becomes problematic when the locus of value for the PO—or above the PO—shifts frequently.




Parts of Ownership

Part of ownership is the construction of information flows from the customer to the product team. 

These flows act as a regulator for pulling work and become fodder for the synthesis of new concepts. 

This labor strikes me as the vertex between the design and business points in the rouleaux triangle—so maybe this is a collaborative labor between the designer and the owner to establish the information flow—and to establish how the information flow is piped into the project... how to use the information to guide/regulate the pulling of work?
