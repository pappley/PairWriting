Product Ownership and Work of the Highest Value

“I’ve never been a product owner before so I am not exactly sure what I should be doing”

What should a Product Owner be focused on? What does it mean to “own” the product? Why does work feel disjointed and lack meaningful flow and sequence?



Provocation 1: 
The job of the PO is to determine acceptance criteria and pull the highest value work when there is capacity.

This becomes problematic when, from the product owner’s perspective, the WHOLE PROJECT is the highest value work. 

This becomes problematic when the locus of value for the PO—or above the PO—shifts frequently.

##Death to the Product Owner

The word ownership brings with it a singular responsibility that perhaps  impeeds the creation of long-term, healthy, high-functioning teams. It places accountability for the success of the product on one person, and therefore grants that person a position of authority that isn't always useful.

- Ownership can mean control.

- Ownership can mean decision-making power.

- The title of owner can embue its holder with knowledge that isn't present.


Instead, maybe there should be responsibility: Someone needs to be responsible for finding/listening/representing the customers' and users' needs (explicit and implicit); someone needs to be responsible for the construction of the product, to satisfy those needs in way that engages the customer and user; someone needs to be responsible for making sure the path forward is sustainable, profitable(?), and cleared of obstacles.

Each one of these responsibilities is not a one person job. It is some combination of the team members that work to do this.


The transmition of information is everyone's job. The gathering of information is everyone's job. The kind of information gathered, and the way it's shared and used to make decisions feels like something that clearly distinguishes valuable teams (and products) from teams (and products) that may fail.


### Responsiblity for representing the customer
- This labor strikes me as the vertex between the design and business points in the rouleaux triangle—so maybe this is a collaborative labor between the designer and the owner to establish the information flow—and to establish how the information flow is piped into the project... how to use the information to guide/regulate the pulling of work?

Everything I wrote above I believe in, but I'm not sure my life experience always bears this out. I need to be honest and acknowledge that succesful products and projects sometimes come from driving, relentless ownership (and all of the negative connotations I've attached to that word above). Is that success sustainable? I don't know, I certainly wouldn't want to be part of those teams over the long term.
